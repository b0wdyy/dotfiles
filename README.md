# .dotfiles
Repository where my most precious dotfiles live. I absolutely need these when I setup a new machine. Or just when I want to use my config. This is the single source of truth for all my config files. I want to add my fsh config too, but not just yet.

# Contents
Uhm well... Tmux is one. Neovim is a second one. Maybe fsh config in the future.

# Neovim setup
This requires Neovim 0.8 or higher. Go to Neovim repo and build it from source. Make sure you have packer installed.

# Fonts
Install a Nerd Font. You can search for getnf on GitHub. Or just search Nerd Fonts on Google.
